Allelogram ReadMe----------------------------------------Version 2.2January 9, 2009----------------------------------------Carl J. Manastermanaster@pobox.comhttp://groups.yahoo.com/group/allelogram/http://allelogram.googlecode.com========================================What is it?Allelogram is an open source program that helps you find errors in microsatellite genotypes, "bin" microsatellite alleles to provide consistent data for downstream genetic analysis, and normalize them for better binning.----------------------------------------System Requirements¥ Mac OSX, Windows, or (probably) Unix¥ÊJava 1.5----------------------------------------SupportThe first line of support is the online discussion group athttp://groups.yahoo.com/group/allelogram/where fellow users of the program may have answers to your questions and where support documents such as example files and FAQs will be made available for download.If you choose not to join the discussion group, you can also send questions and bug reports directly to me:manaster@pobox.com----------------------------------------Using AllelogramData FilesAllelogram reads standard tab-delimited text files, using a description that you prepare, telling it what values are held in each column.DisplayAllelogram presents all of the alleles from a file as a scatter plot, with size rank along the X axis and size along the Y axis.  The X axis may additionally be sorted by features such as gel or plate.NormalizationAllelogram helps you compensate for between-gel variability by supporting manual and (if you have common positive controls) automatic normalization.BinningWith one menu click, your alleles are grouped into bins by size.  Allelogram will accurately guess at di-, tri-, and tetra- nucleotide repeats, but if your microsatellites have different repeat lengths you can specify them.  You can adjust bin boundaries as needed.ConfigurationYou will need to set up a file format description to tell Allelogram which columns in your data files hold what values.  The User Guide describes this format, and an example is included.----------------------------------------Thanks!To Phil Morin, whose encouragement is largely responsible for Allelogram's availability.To Sara Mesnick, for the example data included with this program.To Tonya Engst, for the definitive document on what belongs in a ReadMe.  I hope it's all here.----------------------------------------
